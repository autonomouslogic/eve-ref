  description: "The Derelik region, sovereign seat of the Ammatar Mandate, became\
    \ the shield to the Amarrian flank in the wake of the Minmatar Rebellion. Derelik\
    \ witnessed many hostile exchanges between the Amarr and rebel forces as the latter\
    \ tried to push deeper into the territory of their former masters. Having held\
    \ their ground, thanks in no small part to the Ammatars' military efforts, the\
    \ Amarr awarded the Ammatar with their own province. However, this portion of\
    \ space shared borders with the newly forming Minmatar Republic as well as the\
    \ Empire, and thus came to be situated in a dark recess surrounded by hostiles.\
    \ \n\nGiven the lack of safe routes elsewhere, the local economies of this region\
    \ were dependent on trade with the Amarr as their primary means of survival. The\
    \ Ammatar persevered over many decades of economic stagnation and limited trade\
    \ partners, and their determination has in recent decades been rewarded with an\
    \ increase in economic prosperity. This harsh trail is a point of pride for all\
    \ who call themselves Ammatar, and it has bolstered their faith in the Amarrian\
    \ way to no end."
