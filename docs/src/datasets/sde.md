Alternative formats are available, for instance, EVE Ref's own [Reference Data](reference-data)
or Fuzzwork's [SDE conversions](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/).

## Old SDE Format (2025 and earlier)
Files in the format `sde-20250303-TRANQUILITY.zip` are from the old SDE format which used to be available at https://developers.eveonline.com/resource/resources.
This was replaced by some major changes and the addition of the JSON Lines format as detailed in [Reworking the SDE: a fresh start for static data](https://developers.eveonline.com/blog/reworking-the-sde-a-fresh-start-for-static-data)

## Really old SDE Formats

A few files exist in the [`older/`](https://data.everef.net/ccp/sde/older/) folder which are from way back in the day.
They are kept here for posterity.
