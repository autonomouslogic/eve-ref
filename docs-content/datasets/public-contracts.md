# Public Contract Snapshots

[These files](https://data.everef.net/public-contracts/) contain full snapshots of all the publicly available contracts.
Additionally, any dynamic (mutated Abyssal) items have their dogma attributes and effects fetched and included as well.
This scrape runs twice per hour at 0 and 30 minutes past the hour.

The archives contain several CSV files and each should be relatively easy to insert directly into a database.

Produced by the [scrape-public-contracts](../commands/scrape-public-contracts.md) command.
